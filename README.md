#Cat Adventure

Oh no! Brave Starbuck is stuck in the living room! There are dogs
everywhere and she needs to escape to the upstairs bedroom, where
there's a warm patch of sunlight she can sleep in safely.

To help her get there, you'll be creating a small text adventure
only in JavaScript. Begin by forking [this repo](https://github.com/shanghaiellen/cat-adventure).
You'll see that it contains two files: an html file and a JavaScript
file. YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WRITE ANY MORE HTML. Let me say that again:

YOU ARE NOT ALLOWED TO WRITE ANY MORE HTML.

Use the JavaScript file to do the following things:

- Create click events on the relevant html elements on the page that
show the user the appropriate information.
- When Starbuck's escape points change, show the right values in the
HTML to accurately reflect these changes.

Once you have created a game that can be won and can be lost in a predictable
way, feel free to continue this project or be done with it.

##Goals
- Refresh your memory with JavaScript
- Increase your comfort level when writing JavaScript
- Practice creating the following in JavaScript:
    - Objects
    - Variables
    - Functions
    - Click events
    - For loops
